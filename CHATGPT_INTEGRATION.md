# 🤖 ChatGPT API Integration Guide for CivicTrack

## ✅ **Blinking Issue Fixed!**

The React page blinking issue has been resolved by:
- ✅ Fixing infinite re-render loop in Dashboard component
- ✅ Memoizing `getUserIssues` function with `useCallback`
- ✅ Removing circular dependencies in useEffect hooks
- ✅ Optimizing state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## 🚀 **ChatGPT Civic Issue Classifier Integration**

Your ChatBot is now ready to integrate with ChatGPT API using your professional civic issue classifier prompt!

### **Quick Integration Steps:**

1. **Get your OpenAI API Key** from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

2. **Update the ChatBot component** in your Layout:

```typescript
// In client/components/Layout.tsx
<ChatBot 
  apiUrl="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
  gptApiKey="your-openai-api-key-here" 
/>
```

3. **Or set as environment variable** (recommended for security):

```bash
# Add to environment variables
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

Then update the component:
```typescript
<ChatBot 
  apiUrl="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
  gptApiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY} 
/>
```
